<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift</h3>
<p>This was a classic for me, I loved the cars before it turned into an action movie.</p>
<h3>Avatar 2</h3>
<p>Pretty sure I almost cried when the boy got killed.</p>
<h3>Home Alone</h3>
<p>Loved this series during Christmas. Reminds me of being a kid again.</p>
